# Single Cell Sequencing

This project aims to analyze data relative to cancer cells and their growth patterns next to blood vessels. We investigated the possibility of predicting the state of a cell (hypoxia or normoxia). We determined its potential danger by studying the mechanisms the cells develop to survive and resist treatments.

Half the files are relative to the inquiry on cells analyzed using the DropSeq technique. The other half are relative to the inquiry on those analyzed using the SmartSeq technique.

Moreover, we focused on two different cell lines: MCF7 and HCC1806. In the files named 'Xcells_...', we tried predicting the belonging of cells to either of the two cell lines starting from their expressions.
